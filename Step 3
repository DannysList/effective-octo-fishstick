Put one of your usb drives into your pc and start rufus, under device, find your usb drive. Make sure it is the right one! Then press "Select" and find your .iso for Windows 10. It might take a few seconds to load, you will then see "Image Option" below that, leave it at Standard Windows Install. Change Partition scheme to MBR and make sure target system says BIOS (Or UEFI-CSM). I change the volume name to whatever the operating system is because well I have quite a few. File System is NTFS, Cluster Size is 4096 click start. Another window will pop up that will give you the chance for a customize windows install (this only happens for win10 no other) I create a local account with the name "User", I select the other 3 checkboxes so you should have all 4 boxes checked. Hit Ok and let it do its thing. It takes around 5-15 mins really depends on your system and what you have going on. Now that is finished? Great! Put it to the side. Do the same with the 2 window 7 isos. Make sure you label which one is 32 bit and 64 bit as you can't install a 64 bit OS on a 32 BIT system. You should have 3 usb drives with 3 operating systems on it.

Now close Rufus and pop a CDR in your cd drive and start imgburn. Locate the Win98SE iso and burn the image to the CDR. I'd burn it at a very slow speed only because remember you are usually going to be using a CD Drive that is some 30-40 years old so it might not be able to read CDRs that are burned at a high speed. I usually throw it on 2-4x and go make a cup of coffee or do the dishes if I want to score points with the wife! Once that is done, I label the cd and write the serials on a piece of paper (if the serial works I then write it on the disc). Throw the Win95 & Win98 drivers (unzipped) onto another blank cd and burn with imgburn. Label that Win95/98 USB drivers. Lastly burn the Win95 iso the same way you burned the Win98SE cd. The only difference is when you label the win95 disc put this serial under it on the cd "33196-OEM-0569071-85340". That serial will work with that edition of win95.

So by the time you get down here you should have 3 USB drives with 3 different operating systems on it, and you should have 3 CD-Rs burned with Win95, Win98SE, and USB drivers.

Now you are prepared!
