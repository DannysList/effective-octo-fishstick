Some questions you might have and the answers

Why win7 Ultimate?  

Because it is the best version of Windows 7 and it has everything we need in it!

Why am I installing windows 10 on a 10 yr old pc? It will slow it down?

Oh it will, But I'll get more into that further down

Windows 98? Why?!?

Because if you have an older laptop or desktop win98 SE is king and incredibly easy to update. There is also a high demand for laptops/pcs that are "plug in ready" as I call it

What is your rule of thumb with updating to the newest OS? Shouldn't all computers just have win10 in it?

In theory yes but sometimes older pcs that aren't worth your time updating (unless you wanna go down that road) you want to just refresh the OS to the one it can handle the best. If it has under 2 GB of ram I only put Win98 SE on it, under 4 GB then win7, if it is newer (2013 and recent) I'll throw win10 in it. Unless there is some absurd reason why there should be a newer OS on there I stay with what I have above.
