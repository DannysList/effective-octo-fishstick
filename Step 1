What you have to purchase or gather....

At the absolute minimal you'll need a flat head or philips head screwdriver. I'd advise against power tools because well, you don't want to strip the screws and more importantly are you trying to resell this or scrap? If scrapping then power tools all the way but reselling you need a bit of care

A pack of 5 or 6 USB sticks at the minimal - You can either grab 2 of these https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Drive-SDCZ60-032G-B35/dp/B0978ZCNSJ/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=usb%2Bstick&sr=8-9&th=1 or grab another pack but do price checking, as of the time of this writing, buying two 3 packs is cheaper than buying a 5 pack. Why? Because that is amazon for you! 

3 Blank CDRs (it pains me as well trust me!) - Don't cheap out! I can't stress this enough, the amount of trouble people have because their cds suck outweighs just buying something a few dollars more. Use Memorex, Verbatim, Maxell.

What you have to download 

I can assure you windows defender/Chrome/Firefox/Edge will have an absolute meltdown with most of these programs. Just trust the vision! Also 99% of these programs are 100% free 

Go to this google drive link and download everything in the "Step 1" Folder

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kKbMOmHoL9lGApJbuQfCXyNFqYdXKtuC?usp=sharing

This folder is probably around 8-10 gigs. I've advise against using google drive to zip it before downloading. You can either grab it one at a time (the largest files are the isos) or you can save it to your google drive and download them at your leasure
